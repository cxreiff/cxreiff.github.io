      <p>
        Hello! I am a software engineer specializing in front-end development. I have experience building clients with tools like TypeScript and React, and have expertise across the full stack as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is my personal site, where I've put photos, writing, and various projects I've been working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site itself also serves as an example (and test environment) of some of my preferred front-end technologies, libraries, and approaches. The source code for the site is publically available 
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jaxreiff/jaxreiff.github.io"
        >
          here
        </a>
        , and links to resources and libraries that I have found useful building the site can be found 
        <a
          href="#/posts/portfolio-site-design"
        >
          here
        </a>
        .
